# Contribution Guidelines

_Hey developers, we're glad to have you here! Before you start contributing to these repositories , remember that it is really important to make this celebration of Open Source inclusive and open to everyone._

These repositories are made by MUJ ACM S-Chap are to help developers like you get started with Open Source.

## In This Repository
In this repository we have made a server for our NodeMCU. 
You can clone the repository from here [IoT using NodeMCU](https://github.com/mujacm/iot_using_nodemcu) .
To start with we have made a simple API route which you can find in the /app/routes folder. If you want to connect the server with your MongoDB then just change the URI in the index.js

You can add more features by adding various route to support the features of NodeMCU project. You can also assume a feature in the NodeMCU project and make a back-end route for it. For example: Currently there is no option to connect a ultrasonic sensor with NodeMCU but in future some one might add it in the NodeMCU repository so you can assume and make a route to get the data from ultrasonic senor.


Please follow the steps written in `CONTRIBUTORS.md` to make a route, model or controller.
