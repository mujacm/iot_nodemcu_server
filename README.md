## In This Repository
In this repository we have made a server for our nodemcu. 
you can clone the repo from here []().
To start with we have made a simple api route which you can find in the /app/routes folder.
If you want to connect the server with you mongoDB then just change the URI in the index.js

You can add more features by adding various route to support the features of nodemcu project.
You can also assume a feature in the modemcu project and make a backend route for it. 
For example: Currently there is no option to connect a ultrasonic sensor with nodemcu but in future some one might add it in the nodemcu repo so you can assume a make a route to get the data from ultrasonic senor.

Please follow the steps written in `CONTRIBUTORS.md` to make a route, model or controller.
